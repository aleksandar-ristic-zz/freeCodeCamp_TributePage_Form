                Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
                long-distance telephone communication by placing loading wire at predetermined intervals along
                the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization").
                Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which later
                became NASA.

                Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering 
                work of the physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. 
                The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American 
                Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.

                Besides his patents he published several dozen scientific disputes, articles, reviews and a 396-page autobiography under the name Michael Pupin, From Immigrant to Inventor (Scribner's, 1923). He won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. It was published in Serbian in 1929 under the title From pastures to scientist.
